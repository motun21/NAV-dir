NAV
The objective of the 3D NAV (Network Architecture Visualization) tool is to supplement the information retrieved from PuTTY and ExtraHop over a map of campus to display where alerts are occuring in a simpler manner. This would benefit the team by pulling information from ExtraHop and CrowdStrike into a more centralized location, increasing efficiency by visualizing the data in a more digestible diagram. 
Authors/Creators of the NAV are: Motunrola Oyemade, Nick Troung, Christopher Lee, Hunter Huang
